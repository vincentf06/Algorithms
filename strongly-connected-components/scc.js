/**
 * Computing strongly connected components of a directed graph.
 * There are more than 800,000 vertices and 5,000,000 edges in the graph.
 * Memery management need to be very careful.
 * Adajcency list is used to represent the graph.
 * Kosarajuâ€™s Two-Pass algorithm is used to find SCCs.
 * Use --stack-size to increase maximum stack size when running the programme,
 * to avoid stack overflow issue caused by the recursive DFS algorithm
 * @todo do the first pass on original graph instead of constructing the reverse graph.
